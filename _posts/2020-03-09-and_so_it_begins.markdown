There is no one real reason why I began software development. It is a culmination of life events that I can can only assume would have led to this path eventually. 

I have been around computers for as long as I can remember. My grandfather enjoyed keeping up with technology and he always made sure to at least learn a little bit about something before deciding whether or not it was worth the energy to go down that path to learn more about it. To set things into perspective, I am older than Internet Explorer. I am almost positive my family was one of the first to have the internet in the town I lived as a child. As I got older, my grandfather went to a technical college to learn more about computer hardware and software and was always using books he got from the store or school as references when talking about the subject. 

Then there was MySpace. Everyone one in my generation had one, and if you didn't learn how to do some basic code, then your profile was going to look like hot garbage. People were sharing code, explaining what line had what output, discovering clever ways to do complex problems. That site was well on it's way to being a stepping stone for people to not only connect, but to connect through programmming.

Looking towards the future, I have no doubts that programming skills will be as important as knowing how to change a tire. Things are becoming easier to automate and humans are creatures of comfort. I do not fear the unknown, but willingly accept it and try to prepare myself as best I can with the knowledge I have.
